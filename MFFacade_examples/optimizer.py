    '''
        Successive Halving is a classic method used in hyperparameter optimization that gradually increases the budget for configurations that perform well.
        It starts by allocating a smaller budget to all configurations and iteratively promotes configurations that show promise to higher budgets.
    '''

    '''
    Hyperband is an adaptive method that explores a large number of configurations early on with smaller budgets and dynamically prunes poorly performing configurations.
    It aims to maximize resource allocation efficiency by quickly discarding underperforming configurations.
